# simple-magit
A quick and easy approach to installing and using Magit

# Prerequisites
A working Emacs installation is required!

# Installation
Perform any necessary backups of the `.emacs.d` directory before running this command!
```
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/cheeze2000/simple-magit ~/.emacs.d
```

# Usage
Run Emacs (preferably in no window mode) with `emacs -nw` in any git repository.
It will take a while for the packages to be installed if this is the first time you launch Emacs.
